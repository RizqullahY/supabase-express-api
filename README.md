# Express-Supabase API Migration

This project is a migration of the previous `vercel-api` project. Due to bugs and integration issues encountered when merging the original API with other projects, it was decided to separate this API into its own repository. The new architecture focuses on using **Express.js** and **Supabase** for improved stability, scalability, and maintainability.

## Features
- **Express.js**: Used for building a modular and flexible API.
- **Supabase**: Serves as the backend for database management and additional services.
- **Separation of Concerns**: Isolated repository for better debugging and feature development.
- **Scalability**: Designed to handle future requirements efficiently.
